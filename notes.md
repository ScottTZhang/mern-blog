## What I pay attention or learn

### [03/24/25] Install React.js and Tailwind CSS and create the first template

`npm create vite@latest`

Confirm proj name, framework (React), and variant (JS + SWC), then:

```
  cd client
  npm install
```

Go to https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite, **choose version v3.4.17**, follow the page:
https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss

**Ctrl+C**: Sends the SIGINT (interrupt) signal to the foreground process, causing it to terminate immediately. This is commonly used to stop a running command or application.

```
  npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
  npx tailwindcss init
  npm run dev  //Must run in client folder
```

### [03/27/25] Create pages and routes

Create folder "pages"
Create About, SignIn, SignUp, Dashboard, Home, 

react-router-dom: React Router DOM is a library that enables dynamic routing in React web applications, allowing the UI to synchronize with the URL without requiring full-page reloads.

Key components of React Router DOM include:​

**BrowserRouter**
: Utilizes the HTML5 history API to manage and synchronize the application's URL.​

**Routes**
: A container for a set of <Route> components, ensuring that only the first matching route is rendered.​

**Route**
: Defines a mapping between a **URL path** and a **React component** to render when the path matches.​

**Link**
: Enables navigation between routes without triggering a full page reload, enhancing the single-page application experience.

In clien folder, `npm i react-router-dom`

App.jsx: `import {BrowserRouter, Routes, Route} from 'react-router-dom';` 

Add and import related components.

### [03/27/25] Create header components

Inside the `<BrowserRouter>`, the `<Header />` component is rendered. This is likely a **shared component** that appears on all pages, such as a navigation bar or site header. 

**Styling : Flowbite React**

https://flowbite-react.com/

https://flowbite-react.com/docs/guides/vite#add-to-existing-project

To achieve buttons reorder/display update on header bar when the browser size changes.

In client folder, `npx flowbite-react@latest init`

Edit Header.jsx

`<Link>`: Link component from react-router-dom is used to create a navigable link. The Link component is a React Router abstraction that allows navigation between routes without triggering a full page reload.

In client folder, `npm i react-icons`

**[Issue]**
`<Button gradientDuoTone="purpleToBlue">` does not work, and replaced with following:

Cause: lib version has updated to new ones. libs that supported gradientDuoTone:
 - flowbite	^1.6.0
 - flowbite-react	^0.5.2

```
<Link to="/sign-in">
  <Button
    className="
      bg-white                 // 默认背景白色
      text-black                // 默认文字黑色
      border border-gray-300    // 默认边框
      hover:bg-gradient-to-r    // 悬停时渐变背景
      hover:from-purple-500     // 渐变色起始
      hover:to-blue-500         // 渐变色结束
      hover:text-white          // 悬停时文字白色
      hover:border-transparent  // 悬停时隐藏边框
      transition-all            // 过渡效果
      duration-300              // 过渡时长300ms
      focus:ring-4              // 焦点状态保留原配置
      focus:ring-blue-300     
      dark:focus:ring-blue-800
    "
  >
    Sign In
  </Button>
</Link>
```

**`order-2`**
: The order property in CSS determines the visual order of flex items within a flex container. By default, all flex items have an order value of 0. Setting order-2 moves this element to a position after elements with lower order values (e.g., order-0 or order-1).

**[Issue]**
`import {Navbar, NavbarCollapse, NavbarLink, NavbarToggle, TextInput, Button} from 'flowbite-react'`

Replace "Navbar.Collapse, Navbar.Link, Navbar.Toggle"

https://flowbite-react.com/docs/components/navbar#default-navbar

**`as={'div'}`**
: In this case, the component will render as a <div> element instead of its default HTML tag.

NavbarLink Rendered as `<div>`:
 - The **`as={'div'}`** prop explicitly instructs the NavbarLink component to render as a `<div>` instead of its default tag (e.g., `<a>`).
 - This means that the NavbarLink itself will be a `<div>` in the DOM.
Link Remains a `<Link>`:
 - It is not affected by the **`as={'div'}`** prop because the as prop only applies to the NavbarLink component.

### [03/29/25] Create and run the server
1. Version control: In package.json:
 - "flowbite": "^1.6.0"  // Allows 1.6.0 ~ 1.999.999
 - "flowbite": "~1.6.0"  // Allows 1.6.0 ~ 1.6.999

**Create Server**:

1. `npm init -y` 是一个快速初始化 Node.js 项目的命令
使用 -y（或 --yes）参数时，npm 会跳过所有配置问题，直接使用默认值填充文件。

2. package.json: add `"type": "module",`

3. `npm i nodemon` updates servers automatically and instantly.

4. package.json: add 
  ```
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "nodemon api/index.js",
      "start": "node api/index.js" /* For production deployment */
    }
  ```
  To use the script, in terminal: `npm run dev`, or, `npm run start`

### [03/30/25] Connect to the database
1. In MERN-blog: `npm install express mongoose dotenv`
2. Create .env file

### [03/31/25] Create user model
1. Create user.model.js

### [03/31/25] Create a test API route
1. Best practice is not to put all api routes in the index.js, because there are too many. For example, for users we have pulls.
2. index.js: 

`import userRoutes from './routes/user.route.js';`

`app.`**`use`**`('/api/user', userRoutes);`

  user.route.js:

`router.get('/test', (req, res) => {//...});`

Then browser needs to use api:

http://localhost:3000/**api/user/test/**

### [03/31/25] Create signup API route
1. `const router = express.Router();`

 - Instance Creation: The `express.Router()` function creates a new router object. This object behaves like a mini Express application, capable of handling middleware and routes.
 - Route Definitions: You can define routes (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on this router instance using methods like `router.get()`, `router.post()`, etc.
 - Middleware: You can also attach middleware to the router to process requests before they reach the route handlers.
 - Export and Use: Typically, the router is exported from the module and then mounted onto a specific path in the main application file using `app.use()`.

2. `app.use(express.json()); // allow json data to be sent to the server`

3. Click **"Browse collections"** to check the data inserted to the MongoDB.

4. Use **bcryptjs** to hash the password.

### [04/03/25] Add a middleware and a function to handle errors

1. **`next()`**:

If a middleware function does not end the request-response cycle (e.g., by sending a response with `res.send()`), it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware or route handler. Without calling next(), the request will hang, as Express will not know how to proceed.

### [04/03/25] Create signup page UI

1. Command + t : to search a file

### [04/03/25] Add functionality to the sign up page

1. **`e.preventDefault()`**:

When an event occurs, such as a form submission or a link click, the browser has a default action associated with that event:

 - For a form submission, the default behavior is to **reload the page** and send the form data to the server.
 - (For a link click (`<a>` tag), the default behavior is to navigate to the URL specified in the href attribute.)

2. **proxy**
```
server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:3000',
        secure: false
        }
    }
  }
```
The proxy property inside the server object is used to define proxy rules. A proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from the client to another server.

If your frontend makes a request like this:
```
const res = await (fetch('/api/auth/signup', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(formData),
}));
```
The Vite proxy will intercept the request to /api/users and forward it to http://localhost:3000/api/users. The backend server running on port 3000 will handle the request and return the response, which is then passed back to the frontend.

3. **Browser -> Inspect -> Network**: to check Headers, Request, Response for the submit status

4. If `required={true}` is used, then it will validate the `<TextInput>` before the `errorMessage` triggers the `<Alert>`

5. React Components Must Return a **Single Parent Element**

In React, every component or conditional rendering block must return a single parent element. Without the <></> fragment, the following code would result in an error because <Spinner> and <span> are sibling elements:

```
  <>
    <Spinner size='sm' />
    <span className="pl-3">Loading...</span>
  </>
```

6. **`const navigate = useNavigate();`**:

Is a **hook** provided by the **react-router-dom** library, which is commonly used for client-side routing in React applications.

  - After Form Submission: Redirect the user to another page after successfully submitting a form. 

### [04/06/25] Create and add the footer component

1. Add the Footer.jsx to App.jsx

2. Version update: Footter.Title => FooterTitle

3. `w-full sm:flex sm:items-center sm:justify-between`

- w-full

This class sets the width of the element to 100% of its parent container.

- sm:items-center

The items-center utility aligns the child elements along the cross-axis (vertical axis in a row layout) to the center.

- sm:justify-between

The first child is aligned to the start, the last child to the end, and any remaining space is distributed between them.

### [04/07/25] Create sign in API route

1. In root directory, `npm i jsonwebtoken`


2. In auth.controller.js:


```
  const token = jwt.sign({id: validUser._id}, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {expiresIn: '1d'});
  res.status(200).cookie('access_token', token, {
    httpOnly: true
  }).json(validUser);
```

The cookie method is used to set a cookie in the HTTP **response**. 

`access_token` : This is the name of the cookie. In this case, it stores the JWT (JSON Web Token) as the value.

`token` : This is the value of the cookie, which in this case is the JWT generated earlier in the code.

`{ httpOnly: true }` : This option makes the cookie HTTP-only, meaning it cannot be accessed via JavaScript on the client-side.

`.json(validUser)` : The json method sends a JSON response to the client. In this case, it sends the validUser object

### [04/07/25] Add functionality to the sign in page

1. Add `finally block` to ensure `setLoading(false)` is called in all cases:
  - *Validation Errors*: If the form fields are invalid,
  - *Server Errors*: If the server responds with an error,
  - *Network Errors*: If an exception is thrown (e.g., network failure),
  - *Successful Sign-In*: If the sign-in is successful, setLoading(false) is still called in the finally block after navigating to the home page.

### [04/07/25] Add redux toolkit

Redux: Save information in front end as global state

1. Install redux in **front end** : npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

2. Redux: 
 - **Store（仓库）**
  **翻译：仓库**
  **理解**：Store 就像这个仓库的大楼，里面存放着所有物品。无论是食物、工具还是服装，都在这一个地方。对于 Redux 来说，store 保存着应用的全部状态，是唯一的全局数据中心。

 - **Slice（仓库区域）**
  **翻译：区域/分片**
  **理解**：为了管理方便，这个大仓库内部会划分为几个不同的区域，每个区域负责存放一类物品，比如食物区、电子产品区、服装区等。Redux 中的 slice 就是把整个 store 根据业务或功能拆分成更小的部分，每个 slice 只关注自己负责的那一部分状态。这样做可以使代码更模块化、易于维护。

 - **Reducer（仓库管理员/操作员）**
  **翻译：变更器/管理者**
  **理解**：每个区域都有一个专门的管理员，负责根据指令调整区域内的物品，比如添加新的库存、修改物品信息或者移除损坏的物品。Redux 中的 reducer 就像这些管理员：它接收当前状态（仓库区域的现有物品）和一个“行动指令”（action），然后返回一个新的状态（更新后的区域内容），而且始终保证原来的状态不被直接修改。

  ```
  const store = configureStore({
    reducer: rootReducer,
  });

  const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    user: userReducer, // Manages the "user" slice of state
    posts: postsReducer, // Manages the "posts" slice of state
  });
  ```
  - The `reducer` key in the configureStore function is **fixed**. It is a required property that specifies the reducer function for the Redux store.
  - The `combineReducers()` function from Redux Toolkit is also fixed. It is used to combine multiple reducers into a single rootReducer.
  - The store is fixed in the sense that there is only one store per application.
  - It combines all the slices and reducers into a single global state.

3. Slice:
```
const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'user',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    signInStart: (state) => {
      state.loading = true;
      state.error = null;
    },
    signInSuccess: (state, action) => {
      state.currentUser = action.payload;
      state.loading = false;
      state.error = null;
    },
    signInFailure: (state, action) => {
      state.loading = false;
      state.error = action.payload;
    },
  }
});
```
 - `name: 'user'`: This is the name of the slice, which will be used as a key in the Redux store.
 - `initialState`: The initial state of the slice, as defined above.
 - `signInSuccess`: It updates `currentUser` with the user data provided in the `action.payload`, sets loading to false to indicate the operation has completed, and clears any errors by setting error to null.
 - `signInFailure`: It sets loading to false to indicate the operation has ended and updates error with the error message provided in the `action.payload`.

4. userSlice.js:
```
export const { signInStart, signInSuccess, signInFailure } = userSlice.actions;
export const userReducer = userSlice.reducer;//add reducer to store
```
 - `userSlice.actions` is an **object** containing the action creators automatically generated by createSlice
 - `userSlice.reducer` is the **single reducer** function generated by createSlice. It combines all the individual reducers (e.g., signInStart, signInSuccess, signInFailure) into one function that can be used by the Redux store. 
 - Compare: `userSlice.reducers` is an **object** containing the individual reducer functions you defined in the slice (e.g., signInStart, signInSuccess, signInFailure). These are used internally by createSlice and are not directly used in the store.

Both `userSlice.actions` and `userSlice.reducer` are dynamically generated by createSlice based on the configuration you provide (e.g., name, initialState, reducers).

5. SignIn.jsx:
```
import {useDispatch} from 'react-redux';
import { signInFailure, signInStart, signInSuccess } from "../redux/user/userSlice";

const {loading, error: errorMessage} = useSelector((state) => state.user);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

//setErrorMessage(error.message);
//setLoading(false); // Reset loading state
dispatch(signInFailure(error.message));
// Dispatch the signInFailure action with the error message. Replace the above code
```
 - The `useSelector` hook is a React-Redux hook that allows functional components to read data from the Redux store. It takes a selector function as an argument, which specifies the part of the state you want to access.
 In this case, the selector function (state) => state.user retrieves the user slice of the Redux state.
 - `(state) => state.user`: `state` is not a fixed variable. It is a parameter passed to the selector function (state) => state.user. The state represents the **entire Redux store state at the time the selector is called.**
 - `state.user`: The `user` key comes from the reducer configuration in the Redux **store**. It is user-defined and represents the name of the state slice managed by the userReducer.
  ```
  export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
      user: userReducer, // 'user' slice is managed by userReducer
    },
  })
  ```
  As a result, the global Redux state will look like this:
  ```
  {
    user: {
      currentUser: null,
      loading: false,
      error: null,
    },
  }
  ```
  - The `name` property in `createSlice()` is used to prefix the action types generated by the slice. For example, if the name is `'user'`, the action types generated will look like:
  `user/signInStart`
  `user/signInSuccess`
  `user/signInFailure`
  The name property is primarily for identifying the slice in the Redux DevTools and for generating action type strings. It does not affect how the state is stored in the Redux store.
  - `error: errorMessage`: Extracts the error property from the user slice and renames it to errorMessage.

6. `dispatch(signInSuccess(data));` in SignIn.jsx not matching `signInSuccess: (state, action) {...}` in userSlice.js
  - The reason signInSuccess(data) does not need to explicitly match the signInSuccess: (state, action) function signature is because of how Redux Toolkit's createSlice automatically generates action creators and handles the action object. 
  - When you define a reducer like `signInSuccess: (state, action)` in createSlice, Redux Toolkit **automatically generates** an **action creator** for it. The generated action creator has the same name as the reducer (signInSuccess) and is designed to accept a `payload` as its argument.
  - The reducer function `signInSuccess: (state, action)` is called when an action with the type 'user/signInSuccess' is dispatched. The `action` object is automatically passed to the reducer, and the `payload` property of the action object contains the data you passed when calling `signInSuccess(data)`.
  - `action.payload`: The action object looks like this:
  ```
  {
    type: 'user/signInSuccess',
    payload: data,
  }
  ```
  - Why the Function Signature Doesn't Need to Match?

    dispatch(signInSuccess(data)); in SignIn.jsx

    signInSuccess: (state, action) {...} in userSlice.js

    - The signInSuccess(data) function is the action creator, and its job is to create an action object with the correct type and payload. The reducer signInSuccess: (state, action) is a separate function that handles the dispatched action. These two functions are connected by the type property of the action object, not by their signatures.

    - **Action Creator**:
      `signInSuccess(data)` generates an action object with a `type` and `payload`.
    - **Reducer**:
      `signInSuccess: (state, action)` processes the action object and updates the state.

    The action object bridges the gap between the action creator and the reducer, so their signatures don't need to match directly.

  **Summary**: 

  1) `signInSuccess(data)` is the action creator that generates an action object with a `type` and `payload`.
  
  2) `signInSuccess: (state, action)` is the reducer that processes the dispatched action and updates the state.

  3) The `data` passed to `signInSuccess(data)` becomes the `payload` in the `action` object, which is then accessed as `action.payload` in the reducer.

  4) The function signatures don't need to match because the action object serves as the intermediary between the action creator and the reducer.


7. Install **Redux DevTools** add-on on browser

### [04/08/25] Add redux persist

**[Issue]**:

After sign in, if I refresh the page, the signed in user will be lost.

In a typical Redux application, the state is stored in memory and is reset whenever the page is refreshed. **redux-persist** solves this problem by saving the Redux state to a persistent storage medium, such as **localStorage, sessionStorage**, or other custom storage engines.

Purpose: To save information locally.

  - In client folder, npm i redux-persist

redux-persist may introduce non-serializable values (e.g., **promises**) into the state, which would trigger warnings or errors if the serializableCheck middleware is enabled.

### [04/10/25] Add Google OAuth functionality

1. Create project at firebase.google.com

2. Clien side: npm install firebase

3. .env in clien variable must start with 'VITE'

These variables can be accessed in the client-side code using `import.meta.env`

4. Complete **Authentication** from firebase

### [04/13/25] Update header component with user data
1. Fixed "A resource is blocked by OpaqueResponseBlocking" issue

 - `npm install cors`
 - Update index.js:
    ```
    import cors from 'cors';

    app.use(cors({
      origin: 'http://localhost:3000', // Replace with your frontend's URL
      methods: ['GET', 'POST'], // Allowed HTTP methods
      credentials: true, // Allow cookies if needed
    }));
    ```

2. const { currentUser } = useSelector((state) => state.user); // For use user data
  
  //state represents the entire Redux state.
  
  //state.user.currentUser is the specific part of the state being accessed.

3. `className='block text-sm'`

When an element is styled with display: block, it: 

(1) Takes Up Full Width. 

(2) Starts on a New Line. 

(3) Default for Block Elements: Many HTML elements, such as `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>`, are block-level by default. The block class can be used to explicitly set this behavior for elements that are not block-level by default, such as `<span>` or `<a>`, **making them stack vertically**.

### [04/14/25] Complete dark mode functionality
1. In JavaScript, a **default export** allows you to export a single value (e.g., a function, object, or variable) from a module. When importing a default export, you can name the imported value anything you like.

`export default themeSlice.reducer;`

`import themeReducer from './theme/themeSlice';` 

themeReducer is any name I can use

2. **Issue**: ThemeProvider className is toggle correctly, but the style is not applied.

[Solution]:

Verify that your Tailwind CSS configuration supports dark mode (darkMode: "class").

In tailwind.config.js: add `darkMode: 'class',`

3. `min-h-screen`

Responsive Design: The min-h-screen class ensures that the element adapts to the height of the user's viewport, making it ideal for responsive layouts.
Utility-First Approach: By using a utility class like min-h-screen, you can quickly apply this behavior without writing custom CSS.
Improved Aesthetics: It helps create visually balanced layouts by ensuring that sections or pages always fill the screen, even with minimal content.

### [04/19/25] Make the dashboard private

1. Navigate is a component; useNavigate is a hook.

2. `<Outlet />` component:

The `Outlet` is used to render the specific content of the child route while keeping the shared layout intact.

  ```
  <Route element={<PrivateRoute />}>
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
  </Route>
  ```
  - The PrivateRoute component is rendered first because it is specified as the element for the outer `<Route>`.
  - The PrivateRoute component performs a check (e.g., verifying if the user is logged in or has the necessary permissions).
  - If the check passes, the **Outlet** component inside PrivateRoute renders the child route, which in this case is the **Dashboard** component.
  - If the check fails, the PrivateRoute component redirects the user to another route, such as `/sign-in`.

### [04/19/25] Complete sidebar of the dashboard

1. Check the error when the page is empty: Go to the browser Inspect -> Console.

2. The `useEffect` hook takes two arguments:

  - **Effect Function**: A callback function that contains the side effect logic. This function is executed after the component renders.
  - **Dependency Array (optional)**: An array of values that the effect depends on. The effect will re-run only if one of these values changes. If omitted, the effect runs after every render.
  - **Common Use Cases**: Fetching Data, Listening to Events, Synchronizing State with Props
  - Dependency Array Behavior:

    Empty Array ([]): The effect runs only once after the initial render, similar to componentDidMount.

    No Array: The effect runs after every render, similar to combining componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

    Specific Dependencies: The effect runs only when one of the specified dependencies changes.

### [04/19/25] Complete profile page UI
